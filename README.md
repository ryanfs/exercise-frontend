# VICE Front End Coding Exercise

## Here is my completed app

 - Start the client side app with `yarn run start`
 - Start the json server with `yarn start-api`
 - Run the tests with `yarn run test`

## What you will see:
 - It is styled based on the provided screenshots.
 - It's responsive, the nav is at the top of the page for large screens, and at the bottom of the page for small screens
 - I used functional components for the "dumb" view components
 - I kept the code as minimal and clean as possible
 - Added one test

Below is a HTML/CSS/JS exercise that involves building out a web component, or single page app, to navigate through various VICE shows.

- Use HTML5 semantic markup elements.
- Write your CSS using a preprocessor (Sass).
- Use React as your JavaScript library and try to avoid using Create React App.
- Add one or more unit tests using Jest or Mocha/Chai.
- Bonus: Use a module bundler or task manager such as Webpack to compile static assets. Along with this, include a linter for your code (ESLint, Prettier, ect.).

## Exercise
In index.html, rebuild the mocks in the designs folder in semantic HTML, CSS and JS. The designs represent layouts in a smaller screen and a larger screen. It is not 2 pages. Feel free to diverge from the designs and apply your own creativity. The goal is to build a simple UI that allows users to navigate between various shows while displaying the corresponding meta data for each.

## Specs:
- There are 10 shows, each with an id, title, episode count, and cover art. (see shows.json).
- Load the data using AJAX from `http://localhost:3000/shows` (you can start the server up using `yarn start-api`)
- When landing on the page initially, the first show should be selected.
- When clicking through the show selector the single show image, title, and episode count also updates.
- The url updates with the currently selected show. (http://{{page_url}}?id=b2, if second show is selected)
- A url with http://{{page_url}}?id=b2 should have the second show selected on page reload.
- When clicking between shows, hitting “Back” and “Forward” on the browser will also update the url, cover image, title, and episode count according to the show id.
- The minimum width of the screen is 320px. The horizontal breakpoint is at 980px. Build with a mobile first approach.
